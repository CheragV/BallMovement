# BallMovement
This is a react-native repository to keep track of various animations learned yet. I would recommend beginners to have a look.

The folder JSFiles contain files having different types of animations

All you need to do to run this app is change the value of PanResponder in the View inside index.ios.js

      <View style={styles.container}>
        <PanResponder#/>                //Replace # with the file number you want to use currently and you are good to go
      </View>


The files here may and are copied for some parts, this is just to understand the workflow of various components and is totally for learning purpose. !Peace!
